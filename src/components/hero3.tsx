        <p className="text-md">
          Justice AI was built to uphold integrity in digital and financial
          ecosystems, providing a robust, transparent, and efficient mechanism
          for accountability. Our goal is to ensure that, in a world
          increasingly shaped by technology, everyone has access to tools that
          promote equity and reduce the potential for manipulation. This is
          especially crucial as industries like cryptocurrency and online
          governance grow in importance. Justice AI stands as an unbiased,
          decentralized force, applying AI to track, report, and prevent unfair
          practices. Tokenomics: Fairness and Transparency at the Core
        </p>

        <p>
          Justice AIâ€™s tokenomics model reflects our commitment to a
          decentralized, community-oriented ecosystem. With a total supply of
          *1,000,000,000 $JusticeAI tokens, we have taken the unique approach of
          **burning the entire supply into liquidity*, ensuring that Justice AI
          remains fully decentralized and resilient to price manipulation.
