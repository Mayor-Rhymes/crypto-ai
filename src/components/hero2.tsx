      <p className="text-md">
        In a world filled with corruption and oppression, the Legislative,
        Executive and Judicial arms of government is completely corrupt and
        compromised all over the world. There is complete disregard and abuse of
        power in every sector of government . Just imagine we have a system
        thatâ€™s pure, free and fair, imagine everyone whether rich or poor can
        get justice. Thatâ€™s what JUSTICE AI ðŸ¤– stand for, equality, fairness and
        justice. This is just the beginning of our journey with the current
        administration elect we are going to achieve way more than our set
        goals.
